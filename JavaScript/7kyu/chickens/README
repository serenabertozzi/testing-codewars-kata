Bob is a chicken sexer. His job is to sort baby chicks into a Male(M) and Female(F) piles. 
When bob can't guess can throw his hands up and declare it with a '?'.

Bob's bosses don't trust Bob's ability just yet, so they have paired him with an expert sexer. 
All of Bob's decisions will be checked against the expert's choices to generate a correctness score.

Scoring Rules
When they agree, he gets 1 point.
When they disagree but one has said '?', he gets 0.5 points.
When they disagree completely, he gets 0 points.


Input  => 2 arrays
Output => integer

Example:
```
bob = ['M', '?', 'M'], expert = ['M', 'F', '?']) => 2 
M = M => 1
? != F => 0.5
M != ? => 0.5
```


Tests:
```
["M"], ["M"] => 1
["?"], ["F"] => 0.5
["F"], ["M"] => 0
["M", "F"], ["M", "F"] => 2
```

Ideas:

- compare the two arrays
- use a for cicle and a for each within?
